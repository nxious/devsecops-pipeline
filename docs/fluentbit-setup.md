# Setting up fluent-bit

In this section, we will implement log publishing to S3 using fluent-bit as per second point of [`Task 4`](../problem-statement/#task-4) listed under the [Problem Statement](../problem-statement).

We will install and configure fluent-bit as a service to publish Jenkins logs to a S3 bucket.
