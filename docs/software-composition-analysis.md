# Software Composition Analysis (SCA)

## Objective

This section aims to accomplish the objective listed as 4th point of [`Task 1`](../problem-statement/#task-1) under the [Problem Statement](../problem-statement).

## What is SCA?

Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is a segment of the application security testing (AST) tool group that deals with managing open source component use. SCA tools perform automated scans of an application’s code base, including related artifacts such as containers and registries, to identify all open source components, their license compliance data, and any security vulnerabilities.

## Tools used for SCA

Each tool used was added as a new stage in the `jenkinsfile`. 

### npm audit

`npm audit` is an inbuilt feature of the Node Package Manager (`npm`) since version 6 and is responsible for performing a security review of the project’s dependency tree. Audit reports generated by `npm audit` contain information about security vulnerabilities in your project dependencies and 

#### Installation

Since `npm audit` is paired with npm, there is no need to install anything. However if you're using an older version of `npm`, you can upgrade to the latest version by using the following command :

```
sudo npm install -g npm@latest
```

#### Usage

To use npm audit in a Jenkins environment, I went with `npm-audit-ci-wrapper` which perform the function of npm audit without interrupting the Jenkins flow with an error code. 

The report was generated in `JSON` format and saved to `~/reports` folder.

The final `npm audit` stage looked like this:

```
stage ('Performing NPM audit') {
    steps {
            sh '''
                npm-audit-ci-wrapper --json > ~/reports/npm-audit.json
            '''
    }
}
```
